As a skilled and passionate full stack developer, I've helped numerous clients from around the world, meet their needs and goals through building out MVPs and internal tools to help streamline their operations.

Much of my experience has been in the development of CRUD dashboards, using Next.js and Typescript, interfacing with a database hosted by a serverless provider such as Firebase and Supabase.

I've built countless authentication integrations with Firebase and Supabase and have plenty of experience working with popular REST APIs such as Stripe, Plaid, Google Maps and Google Places.

I've worked on projects ranging from chat applications to Stripe checkout flows, from a tool to automatically generate dashboards all the way to building out an MVP for a React Native app, replicating Acorns but for carbon credits.

In addition to these projects I've also achieved Top Rated status on Upwork, as well as a 100% Job Success Score, demonstrating by ability to continually and reliably deliver quality work to my clients.

Some of my public reviews include:

        <p>Project was fairly complex with a number of APIs Ben hadn't used previously. He picked them up and used them quickly and wrote great code. Best freelancer I've worked with by far, highly recommend.</p>

        <p>Benjamin has been the best developer we've ever worked with on Upwork. We needed a complex checkout flow using Stripe Elements built with React, and we previously hired a developer before Benjamin that was unable to complete the task. Not only was Benjamin able to make a beautiful page that was optimized for both desktop and mobile, he did so before the estimated completion date. He was extremely responsive, and we're very impressed with his developer abilities. We're already planning on working with him again soon.</p>
